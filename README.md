# SIGN-OFF-TIMING-ANALYSIS
This repository contains the whole summary of hands on done by Abhinav Prakash (IS22MTECH14002) during the workshop SIGN-OFF-TIMING-ANALYSIS-using-OpenLane-SKY130 organised by VSD. The full STA flow was implemented using OpenLANE with SKY130nm PDK.

### STA Defination
Static timing analysis (STA) is a method of validating the timing performance of a design by checking all possible paths for timing violations. STA breaks a design down into timing paths, calculates the signal propagation delay along each path, and checks for violations of timing constraints inside the design and at the input/output interface.

#### Inputs to an STA 
- Gate level netlist which has a design representation
- SDC or Input Constrains file
- Logic Libraries which contain informattion about our standard cells, gates and their delays, transition time

### Timing Paths
When performing timing analysis, STA first breaks down the design into smaller portions called **timing paths**. 
STA breaks the path at 
- Ports 
- Sequential Elements

Each timing path consists of the following elements:

- **Startpoint** - The start of a timing path where data is launched by a clock edge or where the data must be available at a specific time. Every startpoint must be either an input port or a register clock pin.
- **Combinational logic network** - Elements that have no memory or internal state. Combinational logic can contain AND, OR, XOR, and inverter elements, but cannot contain flip-flops, latches, registers, or RAM.
- **Endpoint** - The end of a timing path where data is captured by a clock edge or where the data must be available at a specific time. Every endpoint must be either a register data input pin or an output port.

Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to [Kunal Ghosh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunal-ghosh-vlsisystemdesign-com-28084836/){Co-founder of VLSI System Design (VSD) Corp. Pvt. Ltd.} and [Nickson Jose, VLSI Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickson-jose/) {ASoC Physical Design Engineer} for tremendous assistance in planning and presenting this workshop on Advanced-Physical-Design-using-OpenLane-SKY130. The workshop was excellent and well designed, this workshop taught me a lot of new things about the design of GDSII file from RTL using OpenLANE, open source tool.
