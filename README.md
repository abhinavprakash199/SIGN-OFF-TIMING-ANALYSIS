### STA Defination
Static timing analysis (STA) is a method of validating the timing performance of a design by checking all possible paths for timing violations. STA breaks a design down into timing paths, calculates the signal propagation delay along each path, and checks for violations of timing constraints inside the design and at the input/output interface.

#### Inputs to an STA 
- Gate level netlist which has a design representation
- SDC or Input Constrains file
- Logic Libraries which contain informattion about our standard cells, gates and their delays, transition time

### Timing Paths
When performing timing analysis, STA first breaks down the design into smaller portions called **timing paths**. 
STA breaks the path at 
- Ports 
- Sequential Elements
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/219847761-3572ebee-a802-4e65-bcce-ea63ed887ce7.png">

    
Each timing path consists of the following elements:

- **Startpoint** - The start of a timing path where data is launched by a clock edge or where the data must be available at a specific time. Every startpoint must be either an input port or a register clock pin.
- **Combinational logic network** - Elements that have no memory or internal state. Combinational logic can contain AND, OR, XOR, and inverter elements, but cannot contain flip-flops, latches, registers, or RAM.
- **Endpoint** - The end of a timing path where data is captured by a clock edge or where the data must be available at a specific time. Every endpoint must be either a register data input pin or an output port.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/219847775-09ca2042-0b46-4c1f-b6ff-918e7fb9a7b2.png">

A combinational logic cloud might contain multiple paths, as shown in the following figure. STA uses the longest path to calculate a maximum delay and the shortest path to calculate a minimum delay.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/219847787-7cf1cadd-e262-48d2-a757-90ff3075a1f7.png">

### Setup & Hold Checks
- A **setup check** specifies how much time is necessary for data to be available at the input of a sequential device before the clock edge that captures the data in the device. This check enforces a **maximum delay** on the data path relative to the clock edge. 
- A **hold check** specifies how much time is necessary for data to be stable at the input of a sequential device after the clock edge that captures the data in the device. This check enforces a **minimum delay** on the data path relative to the clock edge.
- Setup and Hold time of a flop is dependent on 
    1. Technology node(65nm or 180nm)
    2. or values are available in logic libraries 
 
### Slack Calculation 
```
Slack = Data Requierd Time - Data Arrival Time 
```

#### Data Arrival Time

### SDC File
- A standard file format, Synopsys Design Constraint (SDC), is used to specify timing and other design constraints. The constraints are specified as tcl commands.
- SDC commands are the set of commands which are provided as an input to STA Tool to do timing analysis
- It contain several constrains specifications like

### Lab 1 
---
First download the working folder
```
git clone https://github.com/vikkisachdeva/openSTA_sta_workshop    
```    
### OpenSTA
OpenSTA is a gate level static timing verifier. As a stand-alone executable it can be used to verify the timing of a design using standard file formats.
- Verilog netlist
- Liberty library
- SDC timing constraints
- SDF delay annotation
- SPEF parasitics
    
OpenSTA is a Static Timing analysis (STA) tool that takes design, standard cell, constraints as input and perform timing checks on the design.

    
### Inputs to OpenSTA
1. Netlist format(Usually provided in Verilog using read_verilog command)
    
#### Standard cells or lib cells instantiations in `simple.v` file
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/219945195-a945e09c-bf18-4615-a97c-9f057fa43990.png)
  
2. Standard Cells (Provided in .lib format{`sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib`} using read_liberty command). A typical cell will have 
- Input ports definitions
- Output port definitions
- Functionality of the cells
- Input to Output relationship
    
    
3. Timing constraints(Provided in sdc format using read_sdc command)

### Constraints Creation
1. Clocks are defined using `create_clock` command (Lets define a clock with period 50 on port tau2015_clk)
```
    create_clock –period 50 –name tau2015_clk [get_ports tau2015_clk]
```
    
2. IO delays(Primary ports are defined with delays with associated clock: tau2015_clk)
```
    set_input_delay 5 –max –rise [get_ports inp1] –clock tau2015_clk
    set_output_delay -10 –min –fall [get_ports out] –clock tau2015_clk
```
3. Input transitions by environmental factors
```    
    set_input_transition 10 –min –rise [get_ports inp1]
```
4. Capacitive load on output pin
 ```
    set_load –pin_load 4 [get_ports out]
```
#### The `simple.sdc` file 
- Which consists of the clock period, IO delays, input transition and capacitance delays.

### runScript
- In runscript you can define all the commands you want to run in the openSTA tool
- Tool will execute each command sequentially in order(There are some commands which are executed in parallel in some cases)
- Runscript is in `.tcl` format.
#### `run.tcl` script
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/219945663-32af476f-6ab2-4e6f-b099-100624519cf0.png)
- `report_checks` command is used to report timing on the design.   
### Run OpenSTA
• Run openSTA using command 
```
    sta run.tcl -exit | tee run.log
```
    
#### Output of run OpenSTA

### Other Timing Checks
Apart from Hold and Setup checks(which happens in data pins with respect to data pins) STA also dose other types of check like 
- Clock Gating Checks(done on clock enable pin with respect to the clock pin)
- Async Pin Checks(checks when reset pin, set pin, clear pin can be inserted with respect to clock) 
- Data to Data Checks(identify may skew between 2 pins)
    
![Screenshot (2432)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/220008152-e9e18ba2-8a53-46d2-ba26-ba5f8b6d62c9.png)
### Design Rule Checks
Design Rule Checks specifies about
1. Slew/Transition Analysis
    
![Screenshot (2433)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/220009643-a2cb650b-0447-4aae-9da2-fff4fbc33ed5.png)
  
2. Load Analysis
- We can specify minimum and maximum capacitance on ports and nets.
- Also specify the maximum fanout load on ports and output pins.
    
3. Clock Skew Analysis
- It is difference in delay of the clock at different points.
- It is basically the delay between the launch clock and capture clock.
- Skew is said to be positive when caputre clock has more delay.
    
![Screenshot (2435)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/220009675-1187a5b1-ab0f-4735-8176-62f54bb8f021.png)
    
4. Pulse Width Checks
- As clock travels through the path the clock pulse can change(can happen when rise delay and fall delay are not same) called as Shrinked Clock.
- If this shrinked clock is below the certain value then pulse width violation happens.
    
![Screenshot (2436)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/220012119-0e931c35-392c-429e-b1fa-e73cffd47534.png)

### Latch Timing
**Latch can start sampling data from the rising edge(or falling edge) itself and continue sampling till the respective falling edge (or rising edge)** because latches are level sensitive whereas **Flipflop can only sample the data "at" Rising edge or Negative edge** because flipflops are edge sensitive. Both holds the data when they are disable (Latch disable at level and Flipflop disable just after triggering level).
    
Generally designers prefer flip flops over latches because of this edge-triggered property, which makes their life easy to do analysis and interpretation the design. 
    
Latch-based designs are preferred in case of clock frequency in GHz (in high-speed designs). In flip-flop-based high-speed designs, maintaining clock skew is a problem, but latches ease this problem.
    
#### Time Borrowing
Time borrowing is the property of a latch by virtue of which a path ending at a latch can borrow time from the next path in pipeline such that the overall time of the two paths remains the same. The time borrowed by the latch from next stage in pipeline is, then, subtracted from the next path's time.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120498080/220090421-bfa87d2d-25fe-4160-9195-41d7a8ccc69e.png)

#### What difference you see between NAND2_X1 and NAND3_X1
- NAND2_X1 is 2 input nand gate and NAND3_X1 is 3 imput nand gate.
#### What is the difference between ‘simple_max.lib’ and ‘simple_min.lib’
- I compared the file and found they have differnet values in `cell_ fall`, `fall_transition`, `cell_rise` and `rise_transition`of all the cells.

### SPEF Files
- A SPEF (Standard Parasitic Exchange Format) file describes parasitic information of the design. 
- Users would never create this file manually.
- It is automatically generated by the tool. 
- It is mainly used to pass parasitic information from one tool to another.   
 
A Typical SPEF File has 4 main sections
1. Header
2. Name Map
3. Top Level Ports
4. Parasitic description

#### `simple.spef` file
